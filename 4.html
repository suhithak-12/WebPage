            <p>“For the perspective of those interpreting voices, visions, and other unusual experiences in spiritual
                terms, as a connection to the transcendent domain, see, for example, The Center for Spiritual
                Emergence and the memoir My Beautiful Psychosis. For the perspective of those interpreting unusual
                experiences and behaviors, such as “performing excessive religious rituals,” as symptoms of mental
                illness, see, for example, “Religious Delusions” in Medical News Today. For a clinician’s take on this
                subject, see Ron Unger, Working Effectively with the Intersection of Psychosis and Spirituality.
