    <!-- Our Core Message -->
    <section id="core-message" class="content">
        <h2 class="section-title">Our Core Message</h2>
        <p> A psychiatric diagnosis does NOT mean changing one’s life plans, abandoning <br>one’s dreams, inability
          to have family, and living as a chronically ill or disabled<br> person. Recovery happens more often than
          most people realize. Family support <br>plays a key role </p>
